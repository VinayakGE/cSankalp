## cSankalp Ecosystem Overview

**Dual Blockchain Structure:**

1. **Bharat Blockchain:** Focused on regulatory compliance, ensuring all transactions adhere to Indian financial regulations and global standards.
2. **Polygon Blockchain:** Supports scalability, cross-border transactions, and allows for the rapid movement of assets globally.

**Integration of e₹ (CBDC) and c₹ (Crypto Rupee):**
The ecosystem allows seamless conversion between India’s digital currency (e₹) and crypto assets (c₹), enabling frictionless digital payments.

**Process Flow:**
- Fiat currency (INR) → e₹ (CBDC) → c₹ (Crypto Rupee)
- Cross-border transfers and blockchain-based remittances.

## User Onboarding Process

**Step-by-step Onboarding:**
1. **Fiat Deposits via UPI apps (Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe):** Users can deposit INR directly into the system using popular payment apps.
2. **Conversion from INR → e₹ → c₹:** The system automatically converts INR to the government-backed digital currency (e₹) and then to c₹ for use in blockchain-based transactions.
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** The system follows RBI guidelines and ensures AML/KYC mechanisms are in place for all user onboarding and transaction verification.

**Onboarding Flowchart:**
- User selects payment method (e.g., UPI).
- Payment is converted from INR → e₹ → c₹.
- Compliance checks are applied before transaction completion.

## Blockchain and Crypto Exchange Integration

**Integration with Leading Exchanges:**
